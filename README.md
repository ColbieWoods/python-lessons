# Python Lessons for FRC™

Welcome to the wonderful world of Python programming! Whether you've got years of experience or you're completely new 
to the concept of software, these lessons are designed to give an interactive, comprehensive (enough) introduction to 
programming in Python, specifically in the environment of FIRST™ Robotics.


## Getting Started
### What You'll Need
Each item has a link to a download, which you can use directly or as reference.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This will be your primary editor for these lessons.
- [Python VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Jupyter VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) 
  - Alternatively, you can use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for a more feature-complete 
    experience, though this does complicate the workflow.
- [Draw.io integration VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) - for easily making flowcharts
- [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) - used to grade the exercises.

Each of the extensions can be installed directly within VS Code.  

pytest is installed separately, and can be done by opening a terminal (either in VS Code, or using your system's native terminal), and entering the following command, depending on you operating system:
  - Windows: `py -3 -m pip install pytest`
  - macOS/Linux: `pip3 install pytest`



### Caveats
#### Design Expectations
These lessons are designed to be done by students on their own time, and as such they are structured more like an 
interactive textbook, rather than a lesson plan. Additionally, the exercises are designed such that the student 
is expected to get all the answers correct before moving on, and as such it is laregly incompatible with standard letter-grading systems. This is not intended for large-classroom use, but for more of a flipped, one-on-one approach, which 
is suited to the extracurricular, mentor-based system that is used by many FRC teams. If you use these lessons for 
anything outside these design expectations, you're mileage may vary, and good luck.

#### Content Expectations
The author of these lessons is not an expert in Python, and these should not be considered a thorough exploration of 
the Python programming language, or any other tools used in these lessons. There are almost certainly going to be 
inaccurate or incorrect material contained within. In many cases, these are the result of simplification for 
educational purposes, in order to accomodate all learning levels.
