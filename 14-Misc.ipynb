    "\n",
    "In a few different places, we've mentioned list comprehensions. However, we never explicitly covered them because, \n",
    "functionally speaking, they're not much more than syntactical sugar for `for` loops over a list. That said, they're \n",
    "very useful, and extremely convenient when working with list data. Their primary use is to make a basic transformation \n",
    "to each element of a list, and return a new list with that transformation. The basic pattern looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[<expression> for <variable-name> in <collection>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks a bit ike a mixed up `for` loop, but also in square brackets. And that's because, functionally, it kind of \n",
    "is. A list comprehension iterates over the collection you give it, assigning each value in turn to the variable you \n",
    "specify. Nothing new here, that's just a `for` loop. What's different is that the expression you \n",
    "put before the `for` gives the value that will take the position of the current value in the new list. That is, if \n",
    "you're on the 4th element, then the result of the expression will be the 4th element in the new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is kind of an opaque explanation, so it would probably be better just to show you how it works with an example."
